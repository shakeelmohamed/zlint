An opinionated linter for the Zig programming language.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Custom Analysis**. ZLint has its own semantic analyzer, heavily inspired
  by [the Oxc project](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc), that is completely
  separate from the Zig compiler. This means that ZLint still checks and
  understands code that may otherwise be ignored by Zig due to dead code
  elimination.
- ⚡️ **Fast**. Designed from the ground-up to be highly performant, ZLint
  typically takes a few hundred milliseconds to lint large projects.
- 💡 **Understandable**. Error messages are pretty, detailed, and easy to understand.
  Most rules come with explanations on how to fix them and what _exactly_ is wrong.

## ⚡️ Lint Rules

All lints and what they do can be found [here](docs/rules/).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `zlint.json` file in the same directory as `build.zig`. This disables
all default rules, only enabling the ones you choose.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "unsafe-undefined": "error",
    "homeless-try": "warn"
  }
}
```

ZLint also supports [ESLint-like disable directives](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#comment-descriptions) to turn off some or all rules for a specific file.

```zig
// zlint-disable unsafe-undefined -- We need to come back and fix this later
const x: i32 = undefined;
```
